## Findings addressed

### [MEDIUM] Finding #1: Segment error boundary renders raw `error.message` to users (potential internal detail exposure)

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/error.tsx`

**Lines:** 16-23

**Description:** The segment-level error boundary displays `error.message` directly in the UI. Many errors in this codebase are thrown with technical details (API “detail” strings, configuration/env variable names, upstream proxy messages). Rendering these messages verbatim can expose internal implementation details and produces inconsistent user-facing messaging.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [LOW] Finding #2: Segment error boundary logs full error object to browser console

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/error.tsx`

**Lines:** 12-14

**Description:** The error boundary always `console.error(error)` on the client. If error objects/messages contain sensitive or internal details (including upstream error payload fragments), they are written to the user’s browser console.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #3: Global error page renders raw `error.message` and provides no logging/diagnostic signal

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/global-error.tsx`

**Lines:** 10-19

**Description:** The global error UI renders `error.message` verbatim and does not log/report the error anywhere. This combines potential internal-detail exposure with loss of diagnostic context when root-level failures happen.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #4: Developer-token fetch path does not handle network-level fetch rejections; errors can surface as raw thrown messages

**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/musickit.ts`

**Lines:** 53-66

**Description:** `fetchDeveloperToken()` does not guard the `fetch()` call itself. Network failures reject the promise and bypass the “invalid JSON” handling, producing raw thrown errors that bubble to callers. Additionally, it throws `data.error` directly, which is controlled by the server response shape and may contain internal/technical strings.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #5: `isMusicKitAuthorized()` swallows all errors and returns `false`, conflating auth state with config/network failures

**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/musickit.ts`

**Lines:** 140-146

**Description:** `isMusicKitAuthorized()` catches all errors from `initMusicKit()` (including missing app ID, dev-token fetch failures, MusicKit script load failures) and converts them into `false`. Callers cannot distinguish “not authorized” from “MusicKit is broken/misconfigured”.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [LOW] Finding #6: `waitForMusicKit()` leaves timeout pending after resolve (unnecessary timer; late reject attempt)

**File:** `apps/web/src/lib/musickit.ts`

**Lines:** 83-93

**Description:** `waitForMusicKit()` sets an interval and a timeout, but only clears the interval when `window.MusicKit` becomes available. The timeout is never cleared on success; it fires later and calls `reject(...)` after resolve (ignored by Promise semantics, but still executes).

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [HIGH] Finding #7: Matching auto-suggestions swallow MusicKit/search errors, producing silent “No match” outcomes

**File:** `apps/web/src/features/matching/MatchingView.tsx`

**Lines:** 54-79

**Description:** The suggestion loop catches all failures from `searchCatalog()` and silently sets `appleTrack: null`. This masks major failures (not authorized, dev-token fetch failure, MusicKit script not loaded, Apple API error responses) as if there were simply no catalog matches.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [HIGH] Finding #8: Manual search swallows MusicKit/search errors and shows empty results with no error UI

**File:** `apps/web/src/features/matching/MatchingView.tsx`

**Lines:** 100-113

**Description:** Manual search catches all `searchCatalog()` errors and replaces results with an empty list, with no error state or messaging. This makes failures indistinguishable from valid “no results”.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #9: Setlist import surfaces backend/upstream error strings directly to users (inconsistent and potentially internal)

**File:** `apps/web/src/features/setlist-import/SetlistImportView.tsx`

**Lines:** 62-77

**Description:** The import flow displays server-provided `{ error }` verbatim (`setError(message)`), and also displays thrown `err.message` verbatim for other failures (including mapping errors). Since the proxy may forward upstream setlist.fm error text, users can see internal/opaque upstream messages and technical mapping/config errors.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [LOW] Finding #10: Connect flow’s “friendly” error mapping is brittle; raw internal messages can leak through unchanged

**File:** `apps/web/src/features/matching/ConnectAppleMusic.tsx`

**Lines:** 29-37

**Description:** The “friendly” messaging depends on case-sensitive substring checks against an arbitrary error message string. Errors that don’t match these exact substrings pass through as raw messages.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #11: Create-playlist flow interprets “any MusicKit init error” as “needs auth”, delaying/obscuring real failures

**File:** `apps/web/src/features/playlist-export/CreatePlaylistView.tsx`

**Lines:** 42-48

**Description:** This flow relies on `isMusicKitAuthorized()`. Because `isMusicKitAuthorized()` converts all initialization failures into `false`, this component will prompt for authorization even when the underlying failure is configuration/script/token/network-related.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [HIGH] Finding #12: setlist.fm fetch path does not catch network-level `fetch()` failures; structured error return can be bypassed

**File:** `apps/api/src/lib/setlistfm.ts`

**Lines:** 92-97

**Description:** `fetchSetlistFromApi()` calls `fetch()` without a surrounding try/catch. Network failures (DNS, connection errors, timeouts surfaced as rejected promises) will throw and skip returning a `FetchSetlistResult`, causing unexpected exceptions upstream.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #13: Upstream error bodies are propagated (as text) into client-visible error messages

**File:** `apps/api/src/lib/setlistfm.ts`

**Lines:** 111-117, 135-139

**Description:** For non-OK responses, the code reads `res.text()` and uses it (or parsed JSON `message`) as `lastMessage`, which is returned to higher layers. This can include HTML or opaque upstream/internal text. While later layers truncate, the content can still be user-visible and inconsistent.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [HIGH] Finding #14: Proxy handler does not guard against library throws; unexpected rejections can propagate to API layer

**File:** `apps/api/src/routes/setlist/proxy.ts`

**Lines:** 30-31

**Description:** `handleSetlistProxy()` awaits `fetchSetlistFromApi()` without try/catch. If `fetchSetlistFromApi()` throws (e.g., network-level fetch rejection), this function can throw instead of returning the declared `ProxyResponse` union.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #15: Dev-token minting swallows signing failures and returns a generic error with no local diagnostic output

**File:** `apps/api/src/routes/apple/dev-token.ts`

**Lines:** 20-29

**Description:** If JWT signing fails, the error is fully swallowed and replaced with a generic message. This function itself does not emit any diagnostic info, so failures may be opaque depending on the runtime’s error logging.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).

---

### [MEDIUM] Finding #16: Next.js API routes use bare catch-all handling with generic 500s; dev-token error responses also drop no-store headers

**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/apple/dev-token/route.ts`

**Lines:** 10-23

**Description:** The route wraps the call in a bare `catch {}` and returns a generic 500 error body with no diagnostics. Additionally, the success path sets `Cache-Control: no-store` and `Pragma: no-cache`, but the catch path omits them—creating inconsistent caching behavior between success and error responses.

**Fix applied:** Addressed (verification passed).
