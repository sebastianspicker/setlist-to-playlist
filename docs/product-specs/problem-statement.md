# Problem Statement

Concert-goers and fans often want to listen to the exact setlist of a show. setlist.fm holds crowd-sourced setlists, but turning that into a playable playlist (e.g. in Apple Music) is manual and tedious. We want one flow: paste a setlist URL or ID, review and optionally fix track matches, then create the playlist in the user's Apple Music library.
