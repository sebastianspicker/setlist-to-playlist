# New User Onboarding

For MVP, onboarding is minimal: no sign-up on our side. User lands on the app, enters a setlist URL/ID, and when they choose to create the playlist they are prompted to authorize with Apple Music (MusicKit). First-time flow: explain in one sentence that we need Apple Music access to create the playlist in their library; then MusicKit handles the rest.
