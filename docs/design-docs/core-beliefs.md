# Core Beliefs

The app should feel minimal and focused: one job (setlist → playlist), few steps, no account on our side. We rely on Apple Music for identity and playback; we do not compete with the user's existing music experience. Trust is maintained by handling tokens server-side where needed and being transparent about what we do with setlist data (see PRIVACY.md).
