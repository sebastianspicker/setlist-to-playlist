# UX Flows

**Primary flow:** Land on app → Enter setlist URL or ID → See setlist preview → For each track, see suggested Apple match (or "No match") → Optionally correct or search → Click "Create playlist" → Authorize with Apple Music if needed → Playlist created; show success and link to open in Apple Music. Error states: invalid URL/ID, setlist not found, Apple auth failed or revoked, network errors—each with a short, actionable message.
