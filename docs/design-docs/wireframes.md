# Wireframes

MVP wireframes: (1) Single screen or step 1: input field for setlist URL/ID and "Import" button. (2) Setlist view: artist, venue, date, numbered list of tracks. (3) Matching view: each row = setlist track name + suggested Apple track (or empty) + control to change/search. (4) Summary + "Create playlist" button. (5) Success: "Playlist created" and link to Apple Music. To be refined with actual layout and design system.
