# Design System

Start with system fonts and a minimal palette (background, text, primary action). Components (buttons, inputs, cards) can live in `packages/ui` as the design system grows. Accessibility: focus states, labels, and sufficient contrast from the start.

- **Implementation details and checklist:** [../design-system/MASTER.md](../design-system/MASTER.md) (UI/UX Pro Max: focus, touch targets, reduced motion, colors).
- See `docs/references/design-system-reference-llms.txt` for LLM-oriented reference if added.
