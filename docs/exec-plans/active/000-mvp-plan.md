# MVP Execution Plan

High-level order of implementation (see README "Next Steps" for the first week):

1. Monorepo setup and builds
2. Apple Developer Token endpoint
3. setlist.fm integration (client or proxy)
4. Import UI (URL/ID → setlist display)
5. Matching logic in core + tests
6. MusicKit in frontend (auth, search)
7. Matching UI (suggest + correct)
8. Playlist create (MusicKit)
9. PWA basics (manifest, icons)
10. CI (lint, test)

Refine tasks in this file as work progresses. Move to `completed/` when done.
