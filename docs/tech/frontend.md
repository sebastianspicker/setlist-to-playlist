# Frontend

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, React. PWA: `manifest.webmanifest`, icons, optional service worker (e.g. next-pwa or custom). Features live under `apps/web/src/features` (setlist-import, matching, playlist-export). MusicKit JS is loaded in the client; Developer Token is fetched from our API. State: local component state or lightweight store for setlist and match results; no persistence beyond session.
