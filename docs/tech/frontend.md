# Frontend

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, React. The web app reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_MUSIC_APP_ID`) from the environment; see `apps/web/src/lib/config.ts`. API_BASE_URL is used consistently for the Developer Token and setlist proxy requests. All client-side API calls should use `apiUrl()`, `devTokenUrl()`, `setlistProxyUrl()`, or `healthUrl()` from `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` so that changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` changes the requests. In dev, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the API origin (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` if the API is served from the same Next.js app, or the standalone API URL if separate). PWA: `manifest.webmanifest` (linked in layout), icons in `public/icons/`. No service worker is implemented yet; optional for offline shell (e.g. next-pwa or custom). Features live under `apps/web/src/features` (setlist-import, matching, playlist-export). MusicKit JS is loaded in the client; Developer Token is fetched from our API. State: local component state or lightweight store for setlist and match results; no persistence beyond session.
