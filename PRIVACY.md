# Privacy

## Data Minimization

- We do not require an account on our side. You use your own Apple Music account via Apple’s MusicKit; we do not store your Apple credentials.
- Setlist data is fetched from setlist.fm (public data). We use it only to show you the setlist and to create a playlist in your Apple Music library. If we add server-side caching, we may cache setlist responses temporarily; we do not build profiles from this data.
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties for advertising.

## Where Data Lives

- **Apple:** When you authorize the app, Apple Music handles authentication. Playlist creation and catalog search are done through Apple’s APIs under their privacy terms.
- **setlist.fm:** Setlist content comes from setlist.fm’s API. Their terms and privacy policy apply to that data.
- **Our servers:** If we run an API (e.g. for Developer Token or setlist proxy), we may log minimal request data (e.g. IP, path) for operation and security. We do not store your Apple or setlist.fm credentials.

This document is a high-level overview; it may be updated as the product evolves. For formal terms, see TERMS.md.
